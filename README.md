# Pulsar-Star-Prediction
I have implemented Logistic regression in this project to classify if the star is a pulsar star or not. A pulsar star is a highly magnetized rotating compact star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles, these emissions are even detectable on Earth.
